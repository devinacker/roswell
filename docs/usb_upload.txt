Super UFO USB upload protocol

Rather simple, but requires generating a valid and correct copier header for the
ROM being uploaded (see header.txt for details). Otherwise, the ROM may be
rejected or simply not work correctly after loading.

Note that as far as I'm aware, only ROMs that the Super UFO normally supports
can be transferred (otherwise they'd just be unplayable). Just about any
"normal" LoROM or HiROM game up to 32 megabits (4MB) should be okay as long as
the header is correct.

ROMs that aren't one of the supported sizes (4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, or 32 Mbit)
should be padded or mirrored (preferably the latter) before uploading.

The USB device has a vendor ID of 0x1292 and a product ID of 0x4653 and uses
bulk transfers to upload ROMs. (There are actually bulk transfer endpoints in
both directions, but the Super UFO firmware only ever uses it in one direction.)

Select the "USB" option on the Super UFO main menu, which will enable the USB port.
After then opening the outgoing bulk endpoint from the other side, send the 
following:

- an empty string
- 64 bytes of header data (see header.txt)
- 1024 bytes (or more) of ROM data, repeat until finished
- an empty string again

If the header data is correct and all goes well then the ROM should now be in DRAM
and ready to play. Select the "check" option and then select "game check" from the
submenu to verify that all the details about the ROM are correct.
